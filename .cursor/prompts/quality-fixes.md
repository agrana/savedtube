# Summary

The project uses Next.js 15 with NextAuth and Supabase for authentication and data access, but it lacks automated tests and has duplicate configuration files that could cause confusion during builds

Environment variables for Supabase are checked at startup, improving early failure detection, yet the NextAuth route stores refresh tokens without logic to refresh or rotate them, which could lead to expired sessions over time

Protected routes are enforced via middleware, and the session context is provided globally, but the lack of a test script and minimal error handling reduce confidence in long-term reliability

# Recomendations

Consolidate configuration: Merge next.config.ts and next.config.js into a single file to avoid ambiguity about which settings are applied at build time

Token lifecycle management: Implement refresh-token logic in the NextAuth jwt callback so that access tokens are renewed when expired and sensitive tokens are not persisted longer than necessary

Environment handling: Introduce a dedicated config module (e.g., using zod or a similar library) to validate all required environment variables at runtime and prevent accidental exposure of service-role keys to the client

Testing and type safety: Add unit/integration tests and a test script, and consider a tsc --noEmit check to catch type errors in CI

Robust error handling: For client routes such as the dashboard, centralize loading/error states and consider server-side rendering or React Error Boundaries to provide consistent user feedback
